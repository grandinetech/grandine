# Cantina Security Audit Reports: Attack Vectors Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of attack vectors identified in Cantina's public security audit reports. Based on examination of multiple audit reports from Cantina's Solo Security Reviews portfolio, this analysis categorizes common vulnerability patterns and attack vectors found in smart contract audits.

## Methodology

The analysis is based on publicly available audit reports from Cantina's portfolio, including detailed examination of:
- arkis-smart-contracts (Arkis, March-April 2025)
- yieldfi-contracts-v1.1.0 (YieldFi, October-November 2024)
- Additional insights from Cantina's blog and documentation

## Attack Vector Categories

### 1. Financial Manipulation Attacks

#### 1.1 Interest Rate Manipulation
- **Description:** Exploiting missing checkpoints during APY changes to create unfair interest calculations
- **Example:** Missing checkpoint on APY change in Arkis protocol
- **Impact:** Retroactive interest calculation affecting both lenders and borrowers
- **Severity:** High Risk
- **Mitigation:** Implement checkpoint mechanisms before parameter changes

#### 1.2 Slippage Exploitation
- **Description:** MEV/Sandwich attacks on liquidity operations without slippage protection
- **Example:** Curve liquidity removal with zero minimum amounts
- **Impact:** Significant losses due to unfavorable token ratios
- **Severity:** Medium Risk
- **Mitigation:** Implement slippage protection parameters

### 2. Access Control and Authorization Attacks

#### 2.1 Malicious Executor Attack
- **Description:** Exploitation of unvalidated external executor addresses
- **Example:** Missing validation in 1Inch router interactions
- **Impact:** Potential fund siphoning through malicious executors
- **Severity:** Medium Risk
- **Mitigation:** Implement whitelist validation for external executors

#### 2.2 Signature Validation Bypass
- **Description:** Signature libraries failing to revert on invalid signatures
- **Example:** RedStone Oracles signature validation issue
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access or transaction execution
- **Severity:** Medium Risk
- **Mitigation:** Proper signature validation and error handling

### 3. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

#### 3.1 Gas Limit Exhaustion
- **Description:** Functions with unbounded iterations causing gas limit failures
- **Example:** AgreementStaking info function iterating through all users
- **Impact:** DoS of critical verification processes
- **Severity:** Medium Risk
- **Mitigation:** Implement pagination or separate critical functions

#### 3.2 Resource Exhaustion via Gas Inefficiency
- **Description:** Inefficient gas usage patterns leading to resource exhaustion
- **Example:** Inefficient operation ordering in various protocols
- **Impact:** Increased transaction costs and potential DoS
- **Severity:** Low Risk (Gas Optimization)
- **Mitigation:** Optimize gas usage patterns and operation ordering

### 4. Data Integrity and Oracle Attacks

#### 4.1 Oracle Data Manipulation
- **Description:** Exploitation of datafeed thresholds and oracle data validation
- **Example:** Datafeed threshold issues in RedStone Oracles
- **Impact:** Manipulation of price feeds and protocol decisions
- **Severity:** Low to Medium Risk
- **Mitigation:** Implement robust oracle validation and threshold mechanisms

#### 4.2 Memory Management Issues
- **Description:** Memory pointer concerns and data handling vulnerabilities
- **Example:** Memory pointer issues identified in various audits
- **Impact:** Data corruption or unexpected behavior
- **Severity:** Low Risk
- **Mitigation:** Proper memory management and pointer validation

### 5. Code Quality and Implementation Issues

#### 5.1 Code Quality Violations
- **Description:** Structural and readability issues affecting maintainability
- **Example:** Storage ID prefixing and code structure improvements
- **Impact:** Increased risk of future vulnerabilities and maintenance issues
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Mitigation:** Follow coding best practices and style guidelines

#### 5.2 Best Practice Violations
- **Description:** Deviations from established smart contract development practices
- **Example:** Various informational findings across multiple audits
- **Impact:** Reduced code quality and potential security risks
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive code review processes

## Risk Severity Classification

### Critical Risk
- Immediate threat to contract security
- Potential for significant financial loss
- Requires immediate attention and fixes

### High Risk
- Significant security impact
- Potential for financial loss or protocol disruption
- Should be addressed before deployment

### Medium Risk
- Moderate security concerns
- May impact functionality or user experience
- Should be addressed in next development cycle

### Low Risk
- Minor issues with limited impact
- Performance or user experience concerns
- Can be addressed in future updates

### Informational
- Code quality and best practice improvements
- No immediate security impact
- Recommended for long-term maintainability

## Common Attack Patterns

1. **Parameter Manipulation:** Exploiting missing validation or checkpoints during parameter changes
2. **External Dependency Exploitation:** Attacking through unvalidated external contracts or oracles
3. **Resource Exhaustion:** Causing DoS through gas limit or computational resource exhaustion
4. **Access Control Bypass:** Circumventing authorization mechanisms
5. **Economic Attacks:** Manipulating financial calculations or incentive mechanisms

## Recommendations for Protocol Developers

1. **Implement Comprehensive Testing:** Include edge cases and attack scenarios in testing suites
2. **Use Formal Verification:** Apply formal verification methods for critical functions
3. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security reviews, especially after major changes
4. **Follow Best Practices:** Adhere to established smart contract development guidelines
5. **Implement Defense in Depth:** Use multiple layers of security controls
6. **Monitor and Respond:** Establish monitoring systems for detecting unusual activity

## Conclusion

The analysis of Cantina's audit reports reveals consistent patterns in smart contract vulnerabilities. Most critical issues involve financial manipulation and access control, while many findings focus on code quality and best practices. Protocol developers should prioritize addressing high and medium-risk vulnerabilities while maintaining good coding practices to prevent future security issues.

Regular security audits and adherence to best practices remain essential for maintaining secure smart contract protocols in the rapidly evolving DeFi ecosystem.
