Impacts in Scope: YYYY

# 1. Title

Try to use a vulnerability classification and the impact. For example, "Reentrancy in the withdraw function leads to total loss of funds", or "Lack of access control in the update function leads to griefing." After reading the title, the program should understand the basics of what the bug report is about.

# 2. Description

The more details you provide, the faster and more accurately the program can assess your bug report. You should put yourself in the shoes of the program team and ask yourself the question, "Am I describing the vulnerability and its impact clearly, accurately, and without any unnecessary assumptions?"

## Brief/Intro
Provide a very short and concise (one paragraph) statement on what the problem is, and what the consequences would be if the bug were exploited in production/mainnet.

## Vulnerability Details
Offer a detailed explanation of the vulnerability itself. Do not leave out any relevant information. Code snippets should be supplied whenever helpful, as long as they don’t overcrowd the report with unnecessary details. This section should make it obvious that you understand exactly what you’re talking about, and more importantly, it should be clear by this point that the vulnerability does exist.

## Impact Details
Provide a detailed breakdown of possible losses from an exploit, especially if there are funds at risk. This illustrates the severity of the vulnerability, but it also provides the best possible case for you to be paid the correct amount. Make sure the selected impact is within the program’s list of in-scope impacts and matches the impact you selected.

# 3. Proof of Concept

Providing a runnable PoC for your Bug Bounty reports is crucial because it shows that the vulnerability is real. For Solidity smart contracts, you are welcome to use our PoC templates. For standard Bug Bounty Programs, all PoCs must follow the PoC Guidelines and Rules. Breaking these rules may result in your report being rejected as well as action potentially taken against your account.
